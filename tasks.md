Title: Fix Translation Sidebar History Overwrite
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:00

Current behavior:

- Translation sidebar transcripts appear "broken" or flash/disappear because new segments from non-cumulative STT engines (like Deepgram) overwrite previous ones instead of appending.

Plan and scope:

- Modify `setTranscriptions` logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx` to handle both cumulative (WebSpeech) and chunked (Deepgram) inputs.
- Implement intelligent appending/replacing based on text overlap.

Files expected to change:

Plan and scope:
- Implement `splitIntoSentences` utility in `PageClientImpl.tsx`.
- Refactor `handleTranscriptSegment` and participants' listener to process each sentence separately.
- Enhance `LiveCaptions.tsx` with "pseudo-final" emissions based on silence (>800ms).

END LOG

Task ID: T-0042
Title: Use Participant Aliases in Sidebar
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles
Related repo or service: Orbit

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-06 01:30
Current behavior or state:
- Participants are displayed by their default name/identity.
- `display_name` (alias) from Supabase is not utilized in the sidebar.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Fetch `display_name` for participants from Supabase.
- Update `ParticipantsPanel` to prioritize showing the alias.
- Sync alias updates via real-time subscriptions.

Files or modules expected to change:
- lib/ParticipantsPanel.tsx
- lib/orbit/services/roomStateService.ts
- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- Mapping LiveKit participant objects to Supabase rows reliably.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [x] Fetch/Subscribe to participant aliases in `roomStateService.ts`
- [x] Update `ParticipantsPanel` UI to show aliases
- [x] Verify alias display updates via `PageClientImpl.tsx`

END LOG

Files actually modified:
- lib/orbit/services/roomStateService.ts
- lib/ParticipantsPanel.tsx
- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

How it was tested:
