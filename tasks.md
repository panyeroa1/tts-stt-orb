Title: Fix Translation Sidebar History Overwrite
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:00

Current behavior:

- Translation sidebar transcripts appear "broken" or flash/disappear because new segments from non-cumulative STT engines (like Deepgram) overwrite previous ones instead of appending.

Plan and scope:

- Modify `setTranscriptions` logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx` to handle both cumulative (WebSpeech) and chunked (Deepgram) inputs.
- Implement intelligent appending/replacing based on text overlap.

Files expected to change:

- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

END LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:10

Summary of what actually changed:

- Updated `setTranscriptions` state update logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx`.
- Implemented a check to see if new text extends existing text (replace) or is new (append).
- This ensures history is preserved for 1-second chunks from Deepgram while supporting cumulative updates from WebSpeech.

Files actually modified:

- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

How it was tested:

- npm run build (Verified clean build)
- npm run lint (Verified code quality)
